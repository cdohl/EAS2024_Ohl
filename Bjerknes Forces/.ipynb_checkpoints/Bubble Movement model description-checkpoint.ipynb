Because of the stronger driving bubbles radiate sound leading to coupling of neighbouring bubbles $(i,j)$ through the sound emission. This interaction is approximated with the last term in Eq. (6).

Yet for bubbles in close contact are separated by a thin liquid film undergoing oscillatory flow. A proper description would need to take into account viscous effects. Here, we ignore the details of bubbles oscillating at close distance and to prevent coalesence the Bjerknes force becomes repulsive once the bubbles are closer than $R^{eq}_i+R^{eq}_j$.

A positive coefficient is an attractive force, while a negative coefficient is repulsive. The coefficient varies over many orders of magnitude. Therefore, we plot not the value but the logarithm of the coefficient $\\log_{10}|f_B|$ in Fig. M1. Positive coefficients are colored in red and negative (repulsive bubbles) in blue. The three frames of Fig. M1 cover the radii parameter space for the acoustic pressures $p_a$ between $0.1\\,$bar and $1.9\\,$bar. Values very close to zero $\\log_{10}|f_B|<-21$ are omitted. The linear resonance radius is indicated with a circle in Fig. M1a for guidance. Although $f_B$ does not explicitely depend on the distance between the bubbles $d_{12}$ the radial dynamics does. As we are interested in bubbles oscillating nearby each other we fixed the distance to $d_{12}=2(R_1^{eq}+R_2^{eq})$ for the calculations shown in Fig. M1.\n",

Five of them have a radius of $R_1^{eq}=1.5\\,\\mu$m and one bigger has a radius of $R_2^{eq}=5\\,\\mu$m; thus their radii are below and above the linear resonance size. We expect attraction between the small bubbles and repulsion of the small bubbles away from the large bubble (acoustic pressue is $0.1\\,$bar). The simulationn covers 6,000 cycles. Figure M2b depicts the trajectory of all 6 bubbles. The bigger bubble moved to the right while the smaller move first away from the big bubble but later as the repulsive force reduces form a cluster of small bubbles due to their attractive force. A rough estimate of the averaged speed of the bubbles can be obtained from the balance of the drag force, $\\va{F_D}$ with the secondary Bjerknes force $\\va{F_B}$.\n",

We explain the larger velocity of $R_2$ with a higher drag of the micromotor, which then eventually leads to the observed flipping. This larger form drag is ad-hoc modeled by using a 50 times higher viscoisity in the drag formulation of $R_1$, see Eq. (10).
